Project description: For my project, I implemented a game in which the user must play
as a shark and work to collect and dispel of any trash in the sea.  The shark is able
to eat or shoot the trash to get rid of it.  In the process of cleaning up the sea, the 
shark must avoid the large fish otherwise, the shark will explode because "fish are 
friends, not food."  The user wins by collecting all of the trash but loses if the shark
explodes twice from collisions with larger fish. The user can play in night mode where 
the sea is dark, but a light follows the shark.  Additionally, the user can implement a 
God mode. 

The Pizzazz feature that I added: For pizzazz, I implemented Painter's algorithm such
that it appears as if there are fish in the background and can swim behind the rocks.
Additionally, I implemented a light that follows the shark player, and the user has
the ability to play with or without lights.
